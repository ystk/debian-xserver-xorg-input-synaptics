Description: Synaptics TouchPad driver for X.Org server
 This package provides an input driver for the X.Org X server to enable
 advanced features of the Synaptics Touchpad including:
 .
  * Movement with adjustable, non-linear acceleration and speed
  * Button events through short touching of the touchpad
  * Double-Button events through double short touching of the touchpad
  * Dragging through short touching and holding down the finger on the touchpad
  * Middle and right button events on the upper and lower corner of the touchpad
  * Vertical scrolling (button four and five events) through moving the finger 
    on the right side of the touchpad
  * The up/down button sends button four/five events
  * Horizontal scrolling (button six and seven events) through moving the finger 
    on the lower side of the touchpad
  * The multi-buttons send button four/five events, and six/seven events for 
    horizontal scrolling
  * Adjustable finger detection
  * Multifinger taps: two finger for middle button and three finger for right 
    button events. (Needs hardware support. Not all models implement this 
    feature.)
  * Run-time configuration using shared memory. This means you can change 
    parameter settings without restarting the X server (see synclient(1)).
  * It also provides a daemon to disable touchpad while typing at the keyboard 
    and thus avoid unwanted mouse movements (see syndaemon(1)).
